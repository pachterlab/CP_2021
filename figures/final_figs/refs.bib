               visualization tools fail on dense highly clustered networks, so
               we used two aggregation strategies to clarify positional
               mobility over time. First, clusters of Senators who often vote
               the same way capture coalitions, and allow us to measure
               polarization quantitatively through modularity (Newman, 2006;
               Waugh et al., 2009; Poole, 2012). Second, we use role-based
               blockmodels (White et al., 1976) to identify role positions,
               identifying sets of Senators with highly similar tie patterns.
               Our partitioning threshold for roles is stringent, generating
               many roles occupied by single Senators. This combination allows
               us to identify movement between positions over time
               (specifically, we used the Kernighan--Lin improvement of a
               Louvain method greedy partitioning algorithm for modularity
               [Blondel et al., 2008], and CONCOR with an internal similarity
               threshold for roles; see Supplementary materials for details).",

               is used for constructing split networks. We begin by describing
               the output of neighbor-net in terms of the tessellation of
               M\textasciimacron{}0n(R) by associahedra. This highlights the

               ordering and we explain when the neighbor-net tree is the
               neighbor-joining tree. A key observation is that the tree
               constructed in existing implementations of neighbor-net is not a
               neighbor-joining tree. Next, we show that neighbor-net is a
               greedy algorithm for finding circular split systems of minimal

               known that more complex evolutionary scenarios are poorly

               conditions the performance of different hierarchical and dynamic
               likelihood ratio tests, and of Akaike and Bayesian information
               methods, for selecting best-fit models of nucleotide
               substitution. We specifically examine the role of the topology
               used to estimate the likelihood of the different models and the
               importance of the order in which hypotheses are tested. We do
               this by simulating DNA sequences under a known model of
               nucleotide substitution and recording how often this true model
               is recovered by the different methods. Our results suggest that
               model selection is reasonably accurate and indicate that some
               likelihood ratio test methods perform overall better than the

               estimate the likelihood scores does not influence model
               selection unless it is a randomly chosen tree. The order in
               which hypotheses are tested, and the complexity of the initial
               model in the sequence of tests, influence model selection in
               some cases. Model fitting in phylogenetics has been suggested
